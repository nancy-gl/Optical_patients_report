For the Optical Data Analysis;
This report allows to see the Optometric patients appointment details.
The next appointment due date based on the following logic -> 
Age under 25- require an eye exam once a year, 
Age 25 upto and including 55- once every 6 months, 
Age greater than 55- should be having an appointment once every 3 months. 
Also created an indicator or status to see which patients were due for appointments,
the change in their eye measurements from last appointment.
